Physiological Signals Analysis for Pain Recognition

The datatype with the highest Accuracy to Pain was Systolic Blood Pressure, and Diastolic Blood Pressure. Pain produces physiological stress response that includes increased heart rate and breathing rate.  
Moreover, Systolic scores higher than diastolic as systolic is the pressure measured during heart beats, and diastolic is measured during the rests between beats.

Physiological signals with greater variety are beter for pain recogni􀆟on, as seen on our classifier results. Here, during NO_PAIN, the graphs are rela􀆟vely level. However, during PAIN, Diastolic BP and Systolic BP show the most varia􀆟on compared to their no pain state. Whereas Respira􀆟on remains rela􀆟vely level, and EDA has a slight increase. Moreover, the classifier has performed the best on Diastolic BP, and Systolic BP.
Therefore, physiological signals with greater variability can be beter for pain recogni􀆟on because they may reflect a more dynamic and responsive nervous system.
